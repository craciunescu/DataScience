\section*{Introduction}

\begin{document}

The main purpose of this introductory laboratorio practice is to get students
accustomed to the R development environment and to teach to these the basics of
data science with such environment and language.

Work-wise, the practice is divided in the two following parts:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection*{Development on provided dataset}

In this section, the student will have to formalize and develop on a provided
exercise and given dataset by the professor. This does not only enable the
professor to analyze if such student has completely and correctly understood the
contents of the laboratory practice, but it also serves as a starting point for
any student unable to face the workload of such project without any kind of
previous guidance or help.

This specific practice provides the dataset \textit{satelites.txt}, which
contains the \textbf{names} and \textbf{radii} of some of the most common moons
of Uranus. Working with this dataset has been thoroughly explained by the
professor in the almost three laboratory classes dedicated to this specific
practice, so an explanation or any kind of further analysis into this specific
dataset is considered not only redundant, but time-wasting as well.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection*{Development on obtained dataset}

This section of the laboratory practice aims to create a deeper understanding in
the nature of dataset retrieval by the students and to enhance their ability in
the labors of recognising good quality data sources and valid information
retrieval from the various analysis performed on these datasets.

The chosen data source for this exercise was scraped off the webpage
\textit{www.a-z-animals.com}, and the data itself is formed by tuples of the
names of animals and their respective life expentancies. A Python scraping
script has been developed solely with the objective to obtain this data.

Also, as extra work, the authors have completed the analysis of all the
mentioned datasets in Python as well.

\section*{Data analysis}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection*{Satelites dataset}

This dataset has been provided in the \textit{txt} format. In order to input it
into R, the following command must be used.

<<>>=

satelites <- read.table("satelites.txt")

satelites

radius <- satelites$radio

radius

@

When loading external datasets into R, it is important to take into account that
the working directory must be the same as the file's directory when calling
read.table(). Otherwise, one the route to where the found can be found must be
indicated.

Once the data has been read, the authors will proceed to analyze it in the
following way:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection*{Absolute and relative frequencies}

%%%%%%%%%

\textbf{Absolute Frequency}
<<>>= 

absoluteFreq <- function(set) {table(set)}

absoluteFreq(radius)

@

%%%%%%%%%

\textbf{Cumulative Absolute Frequency}
<<>>=

cumAbsoluteFreq <- function(set) {cumsum(absoluteFreq(set))}

cumAbsoluteFreq(radius)

@

%%%%%%%%%

\textbf{Relative Frequency}
<<>>=

relativeFreq <- function(set) {table(set) / length(set)}

relativeFreq(radius)

@

%%%%%%%%%

\textbf{Cumulative Relative Frequency}
<<>>=

cumRelativeFreq <- function(set) {cumsum(relativeFreq(set))}

cumRelativeFreq(radius)

@

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection*{Arithmetic mean}

<<>>=

arithmeticMean <- function(set, usrTrim = 0) (mean(set, trim = usrTrim))

arithmeticMean(radius)

@

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection*{Measures of dispersion}

For this specific section, the following webpage has been used as a \href{http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/dochelp/StatTutorial/Dispersion/index.html#Intro}{reference}

%%%%%%%%%

\textbf{Radius}
<<>>=

range <- function(set) {max(set) - min(set)}

range(radius)

@

%%%%%%%%%

\textbf{Standard deviation}
<<>>=

stdDeviation <- function(set)

{

sd(set) * (sqrt((length(set) - 1) / length(set)))

}

stdDeviation(radius)

@

%%%%%%%%%

\textbf{Variance}

<<>>=

variance <- function(set) {var(set) * (length(set) - 1 / length(set))}

variance(radius)

@

%%%%%%%%%

\textbf{Root mean square}

<<>>=

rootMeanSqr <- function(set) {sqrt(mean(set ^ 2))}

rootMeanSqr(radius)

@

%%%%%%%%%
\textbf{Root mean square anomaly}

<<>>=

rootMeanSqrAn <- function(set) {sqrt(sum(set - mean(set)) ^ 2) / length(set)}

rootMeanSqrAn(radius)

@

%%%%%%%%%

\textbf{Interquartile range}
<<>>=

interQuartRange <- function(set) {IQR(set)}

interQuartRange(radius)

@

%%%%%%%%%

\textbf{Median absolute deviation}
<<>>=

medAbsDeviation <- function(set) {mad(set)}

medAbsDeviation(radius)

@

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection*{Measures of order}

%%%%%%%%%

\textbf{Median}
<<>>=

getMedian <- function(set) {median(set)}

getMedian(radius)

@

%%%%%%%%%

\textbf{Mode}
<<>>=

getMode <- function(set)

{

uniqueVal <- unique(set)

uniqueVal[which.max(tabulate(match(set, uniqueVal)))]

}

getMode(radius)

@

%%%%%%%%%

\textbf{Quartiles}

<<>>=

getQuartiles <- function(set) {quantile(set)}

@

%%%%%%%%%

\textbf{54th quantile}

<<>>=

getQuantiles <- function(set, range = 0) {quantile(set, probs = range)}

getQuantiles(radius, 54)

@

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection*{Cardata dataset}

The same analysis the authors have performed on the previous dataset will be
performed on the Cardata dataset. This time, the variable to use will be called
\textit{mpg} and the 54th quantile and the frequencies are not needed.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In order to analyze \textit{.sav} format, R needs to import the \textit{foreign}
library. 

<<>>=

library(foreign)

@

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Once the file is read, only the data related to \textit{mpg} is going to matter.
Also, there may be empty rows or NAs in these records, one must filter these in
order to perform a correct statistical analysis.

<<>>=

dataset = read.spss("cardata.sav", to.data.frame=TRUE)

mpg = dataset$mpg

mpg = mpg[!is.na(mpg)]


@

Once the data is prepared, the exact same functions as the previous section can
be used.
